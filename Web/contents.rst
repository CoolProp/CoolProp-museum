CoolProp is an open-source database of refrigerant properties, as well as properties of humid air, for use in a wide range of programming environments.  The current refrigerants available at this time are

Pure Fluids:

* Argon, Nitrogen, R134a, R290 (Propane), R744 (Carbon Dioxide), R717 (Ammonia)

Pseudo-Pure Fluids:

* Air, R404A, R407C, R410A, R507A

Originally developed for use in the programming language c, wrappers have been written for Python, and a DLL that can be called from any other language.  In addition, so called flooded properties are included for a mixture of liquids and refrigerants.

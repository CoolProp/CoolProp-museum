Using Scilab and CoolProp
=========================

SWIG and Scilab should theoretically work together, but they don't.  So the easiest thing is just to use a dynamically linked library.

Instructions
============
Download the right DLL for your platform (CoolProp.dll for 32-bit Scilab on windows, CoolProp_x64.dll for 64-bit Scilab on Windows)
    
Select the sample file for your platform (sample_x64.sce for 64-bit Scilab)

Place both files in the same folder.

Run the sample file

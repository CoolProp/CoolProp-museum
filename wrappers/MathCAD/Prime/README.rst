==========================

Info
----

Wrapper built by Scott Polak (scott.polak@aei.com), December 2013


To Use/Build
------------

* Compiled for MathCAD Prime 3.0 64-bit version - the .lib file is for 64-bit, if you want a 32-bit version you need access to the 32-bit version of the mcaduser.lib file for Prime 3.0

* The mcaduser.lib and mcadincl.h files from MathCAD need to be included and linked when building the “CoolProp 4.0 Beta Mathcad Prime 3.0 Wrapper.cpp” file. 

* If you have Mathcad Prime 3.0 installed, you need to put the DLL in the folder: C:\Program Files\PTC\Mathcad Prime 3.0\Custom Functions , or wherever your MathCAD is installed

* There is a copy of the CoolProp wrapper Mathcad demonstration and documentation worksheet, converted to Prime 3.0 format (*.mcdx).

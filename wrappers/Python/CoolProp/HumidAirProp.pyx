    The function is called like

    HAProps('H','T',298.15,'P',101.325,'R',0.5)

    which will return the enthalpy of the air for a set of inputs of dry bulb temperature of 25C, atmospheric pressure, and a relative humidity of 50%.

    This function implements humid air properties based on the analysis in ASHRAE RP-1845 which is available online: http://rp.ashrae.biz/page/ASHRAE-D-RP-1485-20091216.pdf

    It employs real gas properties for both air and water, as well as the most accurate interaction parameters and enhancement factors.  The IAPWS-95 formulation for the properties of water is used throughout in preference to the industrial formulation.  It is unclear why the industrial formulation is used in the first place.

    Since humid air is nominally a binary mixture, three variables are needed to fix the state.  At least one of the input parameters must be dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, dew-point temperature, or humidity ratio.  The others will be calculated.  If the output variable is a transport property (conductivity or viscosity), the state must be able to be found directly - i.e. make sure you give temperature and relative humidity or humidity ratio.  The list of possible input variables are

    There are also strings for the mixture volume and mixture enthalpy that will return the properties on a total humid air flow rate basis, they are given by 'Vha' [units of m^3/kg humid air] and 'Cha' [units of kJ/kg humid air/K] and 'Hha' [units of kJ/kg humid air] respectively.

CoolProp is a thermophysical property database and wrappers for a selection of programming environments

It offers similar functionality to REFPROP, but CoolProp is open-source and free, with flexible licensing terms

It was originally developed by Ian Bell, currently a post-doc at the University of Liege, in Liege, Belgium.

2.2.3 (revision 172)
Added Ethylene, SF6, Ethanol, Methane, Ethane, n-Butane, Isobutane
x(h,p) is much faster due to the avoidance of a lot of saturation routine calls
x(p,Q) is about 200 times faster!!
Added Quality 'Q' as an output
Fixed properties for Air
Fixed ancillaries for Siloxanes

2.2.2 (revision 169)
Added MATLAB wrappers and compiled versions on Windows to batch
Added plots to check solvers for (T,p) and (h,p) in subcooled liquid and superheated vapor regions

2.2.1 (revision 166)
Added the fluid SES36
HAProps added to CoolProp wrapper and added to Excel addin
When using pseudo-pure fluid, saturation density are calculated based on solving for density given T,P and guess value given by ancillary for density 
Improved saturated vapor ancillary for SES36
Changed default names: R717 -> Ammonia, R744 -> CarbonDioxide, R290 -> Propane

2.2.0 (revision 164)
Added the Siloxanes (MM,MDM,MD2M,MD3M,MD4M,D4,D5,D6)
Added a script that will build all the parts (Excel DLL, Python, MATLAB, etc.) and upload to Sourceforge
Very-alpha code for use of CoolProp in Modelica
Enthalpy and pressure are valid inputs for Brine fluids
Added support for quantities package in Python code (If you provide quantities.Quantity instance to CoolProp.CoolProp.Props, the units will be converted to the default units for CoolProp; Default units can be obtained by calling get_index_units(iParam) as a std::string; If a string for the desired output units is passed to Props the units will be converted to the output units)
Internals of CoolProp changed again, added a function called IProps that uses the integer indices for the input terms as well as the fluids - significant speedup.  This is mostly for use with CoolProp.State.State in Python although the same principle can be used elsewhere
Bug fixes for ECS

2.1.0 (revision 154)
Added the fluids Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Helium
Added the output term 'accentric' to get the accentric factor of the fluid
Checking of input temperature now yields errors for bad temperatures below fluid min temp
Fixed T(h,p) and T(s,p) in two-phase region 
Fixed Units on surface tension to N/m

2.0.6 (revision 147)
Fixed entropy of humid air at above-atmospheric pressure (Typo in RP-1485)
Added specific heat of humid air
Changes to setup.py so that it will not build if cython version < 0.17 which is a requirement due to the use of STL containers
Changes to plot module to allow for showing right after plot

2.0.5 (revision 143)
Fixed wetbulb and dewpoint calculations - works correctly now
Added wrappers for MATLAB and Octave to subversion code - not included in source distro

2.0.4 (revision 132)

Fixed setup.py for OSX (I think)
Using cython for wrapping of CoolProp module

Added and fixed CO2 transport properties

2.0.1 (revision 122)
Implemented the method of Akasaka to calculate the saturation state (works great).  H/T to FPROPS for the recommendation
Fixed the calculations for T(h,p) up to a subcooling of 50 K, works fine in superheated vapor

2.0.0 (revision 107)
MAJOR revision to the internals of CoolProp
Entropy added for humid air (Only fully validated at atmospheric pressure)

Added ECS model for calculation of transport properties (somewhat experimental)
Added surface tension for all fluids.  Property key is 'I' for surface tension
Some functions have been removed in order to better handle errors at the C++ level.  
    Tcrit(), Tsat() and pcrit() are gone, in Python call Props('R134a','Tcrit') for instance to get Tcrit
Many other bug fixes.
Documentation to follow.
